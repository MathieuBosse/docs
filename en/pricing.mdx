# Transparent Pricing Structure

PrivAI's pricing is designed to be transparent and directly tied to the value delivered. Unlike subscription models with hidden costs, our structure clearly separates development investment, ongoing maintenance, and actual usage costs. The final price depends entirely on your customized services and scale requirements.

## Pricing Components

### Development Cost (One-time Investment)
The initial development fee covers the complete setup and customization of your AI solution:

- **Base Implementation**: Core AI infrastructure deployment and security setup
- **Feature Customization**: Tailoring specific features to your business processes and data types
- **Integration Complexity**: API connections, SSO, and enterprise system integrations
- **Data Volume**: Indexing and optimization for your document and knowledge base size
- **Security Requirements**: Additional compliance features, BYOK implementation, or custom encryption

### Maintenance (Annual)
Annual maintenance ensures your AI solution remains current, secure, and optimized:

- **Model Updates**: Access to latest AI model improvements and fine-tuning refreshes
- **Security Enhancements**: Ongoing security patches, compliance updates, and threat monitoring
- **Technical Support**: Priority support, performance monitoring, and issue resolution
- **Infrastructure Updates**: Cloud infrastructure optimizations and scaling improvements

### Usage Costs (Variable)
Pay only for what you actually use, billed directly by Google Cloud Platform:

- **AI Inference**: Costs based on actual queries, document processing, and AI generations
- **Storage**: Document storage and vector database usage
- **Data Transfer**: Network costs for data movement and API calls

## Plan Comparison

# AI Augmented by your documents

Imagine an assistant capable of responding **precisely to all your questions**, based directly on your own documents: manuals, procedures, guides, internal reports...

Our **Retrieval and Augmented Generation** technology combines intelligent analysis of your content with the power of a generative AI response engine:  
- It **reads and understands your documents** to identify the most relevant information.  
- It **generates clear and personalized responses**, adapted to your business and your needs.  

No more generic or approximate responses: your teams and your customers obtain **reliable and relevant information, instantly**.  

Whether for chatbots, virtual assistants, or document analysis tools, this solution transforms your data into an **intelligent knowledge engine** at your service.

## RAG process step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Document ingestion">
    Collect and centralize all your documents: PDF, Word, Excel, emails, code source.
    <Check>Prepare documents with metadata: author, date, category.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Vectorization and indexing">
    Transform text into vector embeddings using OpenAI or other models.
    <Check>Create a vector index for fast similarity search.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Contextual search">
    When a question is asked, the engine searches the most relevant documents via similarity measures.
    <Check>Return only the most relevant passages for the context.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Augmented generation">
    Use the retrieved passages as context to generate a precise AI response.
    <Check>Reduce generic or incorrect responses through contextualization.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="5. Feedback and continuous learning">
    Responses can be annotated or validated to improve the model and index.
    <Check>Automatic index update and scoring adjustment.</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Main Capabilities

Your sovereign AI guarantees total protection of your sensitive data. Unlike public solutions like ChatGPT or Copilot, where your information is sent to foreign servers and can be used to train other models, our solution maintains absolute control over your data. Hosted exclusively in Europe, it fully respects GDPR and ensures uncompromising confidentiality, allowing you to benefit from AI advantages without the risks associated with loss of control.

## Key Features

### Secure and sovereign web application

The AI is offered as an intuitive and secure chatbot web application, accessible via browser with strong authentication. It integrates with your business tools (CRM, ERP, intranet) via encrypted connections. Access controlled by granular permissions and audit logs for traceability. Your data is processed exclusively in European infrastructures, eliminating any risk of exposure to non-compliant third-party services.

<Warning>
  Unlike public solutions, your data never leaves Europe: storage, processing, and backups are
  hosted in GDPR-compliant datacenters, ensuring complete digital sovereignty.
</Warning>

### Intelligent document analysis

In addition to our secure approach, the AI can analyze and exploit your internal documents thanks to a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. It queries your files, summarizes your contracts, and responds in natural language, all in a protected environment that preserves the confidentiality of your sensitive information.
